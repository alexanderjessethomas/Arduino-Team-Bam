# Arduino-Team-Bam
Arduino Code that I wrote for my senior capstone project. 

# The Project
This capstone project was to design a system that could work with ride on toy cars younger children have. The catch was this car was meant to be used in the Go-Baby-Go Project, which is a project that is meant to help children with limited mobility become more mobile. 

# Our Solution
The solution my team came up with was to have an onboard system that could used two different/affordable joysticks and then a mobile application that would allow the parents to control the car over bluetooth.
